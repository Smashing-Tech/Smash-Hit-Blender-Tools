# Smash Hit Tools for Blender

**Smash Hit Tools for Blender** is an addon for Blender that allows the creation of segments (parts of levels) for the mobile game *Smash Hit*. Currently, it can handle boxes, obstacles, decals and water to the degree that it should be possible to create segments which look official.

 * Edit various properties for boxes, obstacles, decals, power-ups and water
 * Use a server to quickly test Smash Hit segments with a special client
 * Bake lit mesh files with texture, colour and ambient occlusion
 * Auto-finding templates when APK Editor Studio is open with an APK loaded
 * Custom stone obstacle support (aka "stone hack")
 * Optional lighting effects in mesh files
 * Obstacle picker with the ability to add custom obstacles
 * Segment streching for easier Smash Hit VR support
