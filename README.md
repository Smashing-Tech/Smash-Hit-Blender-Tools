# Smash Hit Tools for Blender

**Smash Hit Tools for Blender** is an addon for Blender that allows the creation of segments (parts of levels) for the mobile game *Smash Hit*. Currently, it can handle boxes, obstacles, decals and water to the degree that it should be possible to create segments which look official.
